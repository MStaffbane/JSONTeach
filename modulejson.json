			"The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters." : "Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea let's do more of those!"
			"More about Vacuums" : "According to PCMag.com Vacuums have come a long way. You no longer have to suffer the indignity of dragging around an unwieldy plastic hose connected to a clumsy, wheeled canister the size of a Galapagos tortoise. In fact, you don’t even need to get off of the couch. Though it still feels like a relatively new product category, there are several good robot vacuums available to help you dispose of dust, pet hair and other debris in your home – without needing to lift a finger. For more information please visit the PCMag.com website."

				"The boom in scientific discoveries and advancements in technology inspired many artists to think about the future in 2000. Robots were imagined to do unproductive work of everyday life such as: vacuum cleaning. grooming. washing floor. washing clothes and cooking food. However these robots have only managed some of these tasks.",
				"Vacuum cleaning robots are very successful than most other domestic robot. Millions of vacuum cleaning robots have already been sold and the number is increasing rapidly.",
				"The Robotic industry was developing in the 1980s and the public could purchase robotic toys for kids. These toy robots were equipped with microcontrollers that guided robots how to walk dance and sing. Today these same robots are more sophisticated and can actually respond to kids. Imagine that.",
				"Humanoid robots are the most anticipated kind of robots. Engineers have been working on many complex problems to make this humanoid robot successful. Some of the main problems were computer vision artificial intelligence balancing systems and battery timing.",
				"George Devol and Joseph Engelberger in 1959 became the first people to make a company called Unimation they designed and manufacted industrial robots. They introduced the first industrial robot to industries. The industrial robots are used for the specialized task in the industries to be performed autonomously."
